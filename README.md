# Technical Test To 3Dves Start Up.

## What They want to I do?
Our wish is to have a pokedex of the pokemon from the first season of the series, there are 150! We want to have an overview where you can see as many pokemon as possible and when you click on it you can have as detailed a view as possible of it. However I wish that detail view doesn't need to be jumped to a different view.

It would be desirable if you could have different types of view, in gallery, table, list, however I want the behavior to always be preserved so that when you select it you can see the detail without losing reference to all the pokemon you were seeing.
